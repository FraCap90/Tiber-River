# Tiber-River

The Qaff.mat file contains simulations for 20,000 maximum annual flood events over the 39 contributing basins of the Tiber according to the TEVERE model schematization.

The data are organized in a four-dimensional matrix: time (10 days by 24 hours); basin (39 sub-basins); Monte Carlo simulation (100); year (200).
